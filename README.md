# My Frontend-Mentor Solutions

This is a collection of websites and website components used as frontend practices. I have placed them within a single website so it could be easier for others to find them.
In addition, these are the websites/website components I create during my Twitch channel streams.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is just a basic static website that leads you the appropriate solution to the a challenge. Remember that these challenges are used to test my capabilities
to create accurate and responsive website/website components both for mobile and desktop users.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

The website could use a great deal of web design flare, at the moment it is pretty dull with not that many colors. I am not a designer, so a cool design would be awesome.

## Lessons Learned:

There are a multitude of challenges to work on; thus, there are many things still to learn.
With that being said, so far, I have learned a lot about flex-box, mobile design responsiveness, and a lot about CSS inheritance and specificity.
